1) Need to look up and style for the UV index
AC: 
WHEN I view the UV index
THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe

UV Scale: 1-11+
Grouped visually by: 1,2 // 3,4,5 // 6,7 // 8,9,10 // 11+
BUT the scale below for instructions

0 to 2: Low
No protection needed. You can safely stay outside using minimal sun protection.

3 to 7: Moderate to High
Protection needed. Seek shade during late morning through mid-afternoon. 
When outside, generously apply broad-spectrum SPF-15 or higher sunscreen on exposed skin, 
and wear protective clothing, a wide-brimmed hat, and sunglasses.

8+: Very High to Extreme
Extra protection needed. Be careful outside, especially during late morning through mid-afternoon. 
If your shadow is shorter than you, seek shade and wear protective clothing, a wide-brimmed hat, and sunglasses,
 and generously apply a minimum of SPF-15, broad-spectrum sunscreen on exposed skin. */
